## About Razorblade.Core & the Razorblade Integrated Management Platform (IMP)
Razorblade.Core is the Core library for the Razorblade Integrated Management Platform (IMP). Razorblade IMP is a fully
extensible and modular suite of integrated systems that allow for easier development, maintenance, and administration of
industrial-scale enterprise applications. As the Core library for Razorblade IMP, this project must be able to support
the ongoing development and creation of limitless systems applications, including, but not limited to, the following
types of applications: Content Management System (CMS), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Enterprise Resource
Planning (ERP), Human Resource Management (HRM), etc.

Razorblade IMP and the Razorblade Core Library are **Open Source** projects built in DotNet Core. The intent is to offer
a robust, modular platform that can be developed and deployed via Windows, Mac, and Linux. This platform will allow for
both Official and custom modules (add-ons, plug-ins, widgets, etc.) and integrations.
